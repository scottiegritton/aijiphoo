This isnt really meant as a debate but i have done Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown many times in the past and it got me interested in DDP Yoga when it first came out, like 10 years ago or more it seems like?? Anyway about 2 weeks ago I purchased DDP Yoga as the prices are now reasonable in a monthly cost. I was disappointed how easy they were, so I switched to the Advanced ones which so far are relatively easy but I will see what week 2 brings. I haven't worked out for 2 years. Hi everyone, I'm kind of in a weird place right now. I'm 5ft3, 28 years old, and weigh 120 lbs. I exercise about 45 mins four times a week and typically I do one insanity, barre, Jillian Michaels yoga meltdown, and p90x a week. I'm also tracking my calories and eat 1244 a day but this has only been going on for several weeks. I've lost about 5 lbs from when I started and feel great and stronger. I also feel thin. I feel really good about my strength and my flattened stomach 
Hi reddit! I'm trying to get back into shape for the summer and thought id get stuck back into yoga. I've found that it really helps with concentration as well as tones and sculpts my body. I usually go and take yoga classes, but with classes being around  an hour and me being on a student budget i thought it may be easier (and cheaper) to do at home. So my question is. Are there online/ videos of yoga classes that you would recommend. im in the process of trying to loose weight I do the 30 Day Shred and Jillian Michael's Yoga Meltdown they are getting boring though. do you ladies have any fun favorites. Willing to trade!! I have BBG 1 (updated & not updated), 2, the HELP plan (updated & not updated), as well as Insanity, P90x, and Brazil Butt Lift complete video programs on my laptop. I also have the following Jillian Michael‚Äôs programs: 30 Day Shred, Body Revolution, 6 Week 6 Pack, Killer Buns & Thighs, Yoga Inferno, Yoga Meltdown. Looking for Body by MG home but any offers/suggestions appreciated!! BBG definitely works, but it took a toll on my joints üòÖ Edited for clarity. Hey guys! I missed you! I know you missed me too! I haven't updated everyone here in the wonderful loseit community on my progress for a while so I figured it was about time. If you'd like to see my previous posts they can be found right here ( here ( and here (http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/. Hi! I'm excited to report that this is my final week of Couch to 5k and I'm really amazed with the results. In all honesty I am a little bit behind because boyfriend's family visited and I went into vacation mode - regardless, I will keep going until I do hit that 5k. I ran my first mile ever a couple of weeks ago, and can now run for about 20 minutes straight (if hills aren't a factor), so I'm confident I'll get that 5k soon. I have incorporated that running program with a self-made schedul.  
This feels like a "dumb question," but I have not been able to find an answer for. I know it is recommended to work out 5-6 times a week for weight loss, but how often should I be doing the same work out? I am mainly using work out videos, such as Jillian Michaels 30 day shred, Yoga meltdown, cardio blast, etc, as well as running outside (when the weather permits) and using an elliptical machine. So my question is, should I only be sticking to one work out? Should I be doing one form of exercise.
